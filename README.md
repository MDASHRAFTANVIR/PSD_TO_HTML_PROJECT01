# PSD_TO_HTML_PROJECT01
PSD to HTML conversion using HTML,CSS,JS &amp; JQUERY. It includes seven menus and seven different sections as well the functional contact section. It's not responsible, but it's a good startup coding exercise for a new learner to know all about HTML and CSS. This project also includes some JS files and Jquery plugins. As it's a PSD to HTML file, it's added all sections in the PSD file.
